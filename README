ranger is a file manager with VI key bindings. (http://ranger.nongnu.org/)

This plugin is similar to nerdtree. It overrides the default file browser (netrw), so if you :edit a directory a ranger will be opened. When you open a file in ranger, it will be opened in vim. You could also select multiple files and open'em all at once (use v to select multiple files in ranger).

tips: Add "nnoremap <f9> :tabe %:p:h<cr>" to your vimrc, so that you could use <f9> to open new files in new tab.
